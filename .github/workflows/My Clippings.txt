Data Collection 1) Twitter Data A developer account was created to connect with Twitter’s API. For the case study on Microsoft, we wanted to explore public opinion about the company’s stock, as well as their products and services. We collected and filtered Tweets in English using keywords, such as #Microsoft, #MSFT, #Microsoft365. From each tweet we extracted the keyword, user id, user account, date of creation and tweet text, and stored these in a database. In total, 90.000 tweets were collected from Twitter during the period from 16-07-2020 to 31-10-2020.2) StockTwits Data The extraction of stock tweets is based on language, time, and company ticker through the search API. Importing the library named requests, the server returns a JSON object of tweets. The object contains the user account, the text of tweets and the date of creation. Tweet extraction is based on the company ticker, like $MSFT. Stock tweets were also stored in the database. In total, 7.440 tweets were collected from StockTwits during the period from 16-07-2020 to 31-10- 2020.3)

There’s no need to capture every idea; the best ones will always come back around eventually. There’s no need to clear your inbox frequently; unlike your to-do list, there’s no negative consequence if you miss a given note. There’s no need to review or summarize notes on a strict timeline; we’re not trying to memorize their contents or keep them top of mind. When organizing notes or files within PARA, it’s a very forgiving decision of where to put something, since search is so effective as a backup option.
